HOW to run Nearest Neighbor Contacts program

1.source("NearestNeighborContacts.R")
2.nearest.neighbor.contacts("elements.txt", "nFile.txt")


Files:

1- elements.txt: Known theoritical values. Example of the file is given below:


N-N ,   O-O,    Zn-Zn , N-O,  N-Zn, O-Zn
1.098, 1.208,    4.19,  1.154,    ,  

If the value is not known use blank insted. The file must alphabettically be ordered based on the variable names.

2- nFile.txt: the  x-axis values that you are interested in, i.e., Tempareture, size, N content (%)
 
The file must be numeracally ordered

Notes:

The programs reads all the .txt files which start with "geom" name and calculates the nearest neighbor contacts for each element.
