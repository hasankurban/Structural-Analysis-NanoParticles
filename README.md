# Structural and Geometircal Analysis of Nanoparticles (NPs)


In this project, we have implemented several functions that can ve used to analyze structural and geometrical analysis of nanoparticles. Our library currently includes the following functions and the new function will be added.

- Order Parameter
- Nearest Neighbor Contacts
- Radial Distribution Functions (RDF)

The paper introducing the software is currently under-review:
