# Structural and Geometrical Analysis of Nanoparticles 


In this project, we have implemented several functions that can be used to analyze structural and geometrical analysis of nanoparticles. Our library currently includes the following functions and new function will be added. Please follow this page for the updates.

- Order Parameter
- Nearest Neighbor Contacts
- Radial Distribution Functions (RDF)

These programs include high resolution visualizations to plot data and the paper introducing the software is currently under-review:
